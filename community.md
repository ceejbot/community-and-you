# [fit] The node community
# [fit] and you

# [fit] Why are you here?

^ If you answer "to learn more about node", that's great. But it's not everything you could get from jsfest. Attendance is not sufficient.

# [fit] Why am I here?

^ I'm going to tell you why I'm here by telling you a story about me and the node community.

## [fit] devops @ ![inline](assets/npm.png)

^ Wow, look at that. NPM. I'm pretty plugged into community right? I'm deep in it! I practically define it! Wasn't always that way.

^ I've been writing software professionally a long time. I first got paid for it in 1996. My community of practice was my coworkers. Found node via async. Taught myself from example source, asked no questions, did not go near IRC.

# [fit] I published a package.

^ This is safest possible way to be part of the node community. Nobody had to know who I was. Nobody had to know I was a woman. Never done it before for any lang.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-3.jpg)

# [fit] I was terrified.

^ What if my package had bugs? It did. What if it used node wrong? Probably it did. Would people yell at me? Laugh at me?

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-fish.jpg)

^ This happens! I've seen people's code get mocked on twitter. What if somebody mocked mine? I'm a pretty tough and cocky person. Nobody yelled at me for publishing a package. In fact, nobody *noticed* that I'd published one. This is the usual result. Security through obscurity. But ...

# [fit] Vulnerability

^ I made myself vulnerable by putting a little of myself out there in public. Any participation in a community requires this.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-fish.jpg)

# [fit] Vulnerability
# [fit] participation has risks

^ You've done this just by showing up here.

----

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

^ This was it for me for a long time. I did some more modules. I got a node job. I met a few people.s

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

# [fit] I went to nodeconf 2013.

^ Next risk I took was going to a conference. I'd gone to SIGCHI about 10 years before.

---

# [fit] I knew one person:
# [fit] my coworker Kit

^ I did a lot of sitting on my own at lunch.

# [fit] I met people like Bryce
# [fit] & Max O & Rod V & jden &â€¦

^ These are people who took the time to talk to me. I'm grateful to all of you. Bryce also knew nobody! He told me so.

----

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-pot.jpg)

^ I saw an amazing live-coding demo by Dominic Tarr & Raynos. I went home and I wrote three modules & published them to npm.

---

# [fit] inspiration!

^ This is awesome! I hope you're all going to go home & monkey patch the hell out of something inappropriate.

---

# [fit] @dominictarr

^ I'm going to tell you a story about Mr Dominic Tarr. He doesn't know he's the star of this story. (mad science talk at conferences)

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-pot.jpg)

# [fit] @dominictarr
# [fit] has no idea that he's my
# [fit] mad science inspiration

^ he doesn't need to have any idea. he just talks about what he's into.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-pot.jpg)

# [fit] your mad science inspiration
# [fit] might be in this room

^ Your inspiration might be dominictarr or nodebotanist or even me. max & mafintosh blew my mind earlier today. I'm going to go home & write something using dat THIS WEEKEND.

---

# [fit] you might be somebody's
# [fit] mad science inspiration

^ nodebotanist is in this room. she's an inspiration.

# [fit] Rick Waldron
# [fit] who gave me a gentle shove

^ also at nodeconf 2013 I also met Rick Waldron who volunteered me to talk about robots at Cascadia.js.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-1.jpg)

# [fit] Public speaking
# [fit] woah

^ I had literally never done that before. I am standing up here today because Rick met me at nodeconf 2013 in his robots session & thought I could do a good job explaining nodebots.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-1.jpg)
# [fit] eventually I got a really
# [fit] great job at npm

^ The culmination of community participation for me: I'm now working on the thing that got me to widen my community of practice.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-cats.jpg)

^ Why did all this happen to me? Am I special? No. I'm just a human being. But I took the first step: I made face-to-face contact with other humans.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-cats.jpg)

# [fit] humans are
# [fit] social animals

^ the value of connecting with other people; face to face contact is how we feel we know each other. Rick thought I could talk because he had met me & seen me coding.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-cats.jpg)

# [fit] the way the world works
# [fit] is not a secret

^ social connections are useful in moving around in the industry.

---

# [fit] surprising things
# [fit] come from new experiences

^ We learn more when we break ourselves out of our ruts & when we talk to new people. We learn new & surprising things when we talk to new & surprising people. I did not know when I walked into this room this morning that I'd be so stoked about DAT.


---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-4.jpg)

^ None of this dropped into my lap.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/cat-island-4.jpg)

# [fit] I took risks

^ Every single one of these opportunities required me taking a risk, trying something I'd never done before, making myself vulnerable. I had to reach out.

----

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

^ The flip side. None of this comes for free.

----

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

# [fit] Responsibility

^ Every one of the opportunities I took advantage of comes with responsibilities. Working at npm is the biggest responsibility of them all because I hold the heart of the community in my dev/ops hands.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

# [fit] you are already part of
# [fit] the node community.

^ You're present at a tiny conference. You could know everybody in this room. Do you? I don't.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

# [fit] Encourage someone

^ Be somebody's inspiration. Listen to somebody. Be kind in your github conversations. Share your code when you can. Mentor a nodeschool. Talk at a conference. Encourage somebody.

---

![](/Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/Talks/community-and-you/assets/tashirojima-island221.jpg)

# [fit] Let yourself be encouraged

^ Take a risk. When somebody offers you an opportunity to share, take it.

# [fit] It'll be better than okay.
# [fit] It'll be great.

^ It'll be okay. The fact that I'm standing here in front of you is an existence proof that it can do AMAZING things for you.
